# Machine_Predictive_Maintenance_Classification
This project aims to predict maintenance needs for machinery using machine learning models. The goal is to classify different types of failures based on sensor data, which could include temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. By leveraging predictive analytics, this system helps in anticipating machinery failures.
